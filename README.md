# Welcome to the Battlezone Scrap Field! 👋

We are a community-managed organization that aims to provide a one-stop shop for Battlezone community members to share their open-source resources or projects.
Feel free to get involved, fork your projects, or create new project repositories here!
Let any of the members know if you have any questions, feedback, or want to help contribute!

## Getting Started 🚀
We'd be happy to have you contribute to this website! Here's how you can contribute:

### Local Environment
- Clone this repo to your local pc.
- Open up `index.html` in your web browser to preview the site.

### Pushing Changes
> Note: the branching process looks like: `your-dev-branch → master → prod`

- Commit your changes to a **new** branch, sourced from `master`. You may call your branch whatever you like (i.e., `"dev-john-cooke"`).
- Create a **Pull Request** to the `master` branch from your newly developed branch. Make sure to give it an adequate title, description, and label!
- Now, sit back and relax! 🏖️ _From here: a code reviewer will review your commits and changes to complete the merge. If your changes look great, your PR to `master` will be approved, which means your new branch `"dev-john-cooke"` will be squashed. A member of the team will create a new PR to merge your changes (that are now in `master`) into `prod`. This will trigger the automated deployment to GitHub Pages!_
